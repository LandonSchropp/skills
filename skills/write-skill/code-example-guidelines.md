# Code Example Guidelines

**One excellent example beats many mediocre ones.** One great example is enough. Choose the most relevant language for the
example—TypeScript/JavaScript are a good fallback if the language is not obvious.

Good examples are:

- Complete and runnable.
- Well-commented explaining WHY.
- From a real scenario.
- Shows the pattern clearly.
- Ready to adapt (not generic).

Avoid:

- Implementing in 5+ languages
- Create fill-in-the-blank templates
- Write contrived examples
